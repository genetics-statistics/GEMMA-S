# GEMMA-S: Genome-wide Efficient Mixed Model Association (Service)

GEMMA is a software toolkit for fast application of linear mixed
models (LMMs) and related models to genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) and other large-scale data sets. This source code repository represents a
version of GEMMA which is under development.

GEMMA as a Service (*GEMMA-S* - it's a GAAS) is a next generation of the original GEMMA. We decided on a fresh start to create a more service oriented solution. For more information see the [big picture](https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/thebird.nl/blog/2021/gemma-big-picture.gmi).

Check out [RELEASE-NOTES.md](RELEASE-NOTES.md) to see what's new in each GEMMA release.

For the stable release of GEMMA, see the [git repository](https://github.com/genetics-statistics/GEMMA).

## FEATURES

For now, GEMMA-S has no real improvements over GEMMA1. For LOCO, parallel compute, permutations and caching, see [gemma-wrapper](https://github.com/genetics-statistics/gemma-wrapper). For validation and BIMBAM/plink/Rqtl2 parsing and conversion see [gemma2lib](https://github.com/genetics-statistics/gemma2lib).

## DEVELOPMENT

To contribute, see the development [docs](doc/gemma-s-development.md).

## Reporting a GEMMA-S bug or issue

For bugs GEMMAv1 has an
[issue tracker](https://github.com/genetics-statistics/GEMMA/issues)
on github. For general support GEMMA has a mailing list at
[gemma-discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gemma-discussion).

Before posting an issue search the issue tracker and mailing list
first. It is likely someone may have encountered something
similiar. Also try running the latest version of GEMMA to make sure it
has not been fixed already. Support/installation questions should be
aimed at the mailing list - it is the best resource to get answers.

The issue tracker is specifically meant for development issues around
the software itself. When reporting an issue include the output of the
program and the contents of the .log.txt file in the output directory.
